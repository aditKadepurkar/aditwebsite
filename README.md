# Adit Kadepurkar's personal website!

## How to run
Open two terminals, run `npm run dev` and `npm run fastapi-dev`

# Design
This website uses a NextJS frontend, a python(fastAPI) backend, and PostgreSQL Database.
The backend API follows the RESTful API protocols and provides a connection to a database and offers useful functions for search options.

# Future plans
Development is always going to be going on this, but if you are reading this, I have at least got around to deploying this.
